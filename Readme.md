Abstract
Stronger pollen limitation should increase competition among plants, leading to stronger selection on traits important for pollen receipt. The few explicit tests of this hypothesis, however, have provided conflicting support. Using the arithmetic relationship between these two quantities, we show that increased pollen limitation will automatically result in stronger selection (all else equal) although other factors can alter selection independently of pollen limitation. We then test the hypothesis using two approaches. First, we analyze published studies containing information on both pollen limitation and selection. Second, we explore how natural selection measured in one Ontario population of Lobelia cardinalis over three years and two Michigan populations in one year relates to pollen limitation. For the Ontario population we also explore whether pollinator-mediated selection is related to pollen limitation. Consistent with the hypothesis, we find an overall positive relationship between selection strength and pollen limitation both among species and within L. cardinalis. Unexpectedly, this relationship holds even for vegetative traits among species, and was not found in L. cardinalis for pollinator-mediated selection on nearly all trait types.

#Data used:
There are two datasets that are used in this study.
The first called part1_data_for_pub.csv is a literature survey used to explore the relationship between selection and pollen limitation. Using Web of Science, we searched for studies citing Lande and Arnold (1983).Based on publication title, 396 studies were found to contain selection estimate(s) for a natural population. For each of these studies, we searched for the occurrence of the words "pollen”, “limitation”, or “limited”. If any of the words was found, the abstract and/or methods of the study were read to determine whether an estimate of selection wasreported as well as an estimate of pollen limitation. For each study we categorized traits into the following five classes: flower size, flower number, plant size, phenology and vegetative. Because different fitness measures were used to assess pollen limitation and a single study often reported multiple estimates, we used the “best pollen limitation" estimate available” by prioritizing the estimates from each study as follows: (1) mean number (or percentage) of seeds, (2) mean number (or percentage) of fruits, (3) mean number (or percentage) of seeds per flower, (4) mean number (or percentage) of seeds per fruit, (5) mean number (or percentage) of fruits per flower and (6) mean number (or percentage) of seeds per ovule.

The second dataset called part2_all_years_data_for_pub.csv.
This is field observations of Lobelia cardinalis. We measured 6 traits: anther-nectary distance, flower width (width of bottom three petals), length to last flower, flower number, daily floral display, and median-flower date.
